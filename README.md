# Predicting-Disease-Risk-through-Historical-Insights

The primary objective of this project is to use a large repository of patients' medical records to predict the likelihood of developing certain disease conditions in the future.

The dataset comprises patients' medical histories obtained via IBM Truven Health Market Scan Research database and purchased by DISC, OU. The data comes from a selection of large employers, health plans, and government and public organizations. The data is stored and managed in PostgreSQL using pgAdmin.

By extracting insights from historical medical records, we offer valuable insights to the FAA and diverse industries like healthcare, government agencies, insurance, and financial services. The prediction of license renewal depends on identifying critical diseases, such as heart diseases, respiratory diseases, and nervous system disorders, listed in the FAA's incapacitating conditions. Selecting 2-3 significant diseases from this list, we will predict their occurrence in patients' future. This prediction aids in determining whether a pilot's license can be renewed as an initial screening method. A key aspect of this process involves evaluating medical exams to gauge their potential for license renewal.

The initial data preprocessing files are attached as .sql and the modeling files are attached as notebook files.
